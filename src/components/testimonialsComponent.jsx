              Nick (installer) very professional and courteous. This is
              definitely not

              Replaced 2 garage doors. Great service – arrived on time and got
              right <br /> to work. The old garage doors never fit quite right
              (even though I built <br /> this house) and the new ones are
              perfect. he also showed me how to <br /> maintain them (oil
              rollers) and the new ones are perfect! I have no <br /> more
              leaking and now have a perfect fit!

              This company & these guys are great. Called them at 7:30, they
              were here by 9:00,
              <br /> done by 11:00. The service technician needed a part to

              another employee. <br /> Great service and the price for the

              These guys are good! Really good! My garage door spring broke{" "}
              <br />
              without me knowing as I noticed a weird noise coming from my{" "}
              <br />
              opener. I soon discovered one spring snapped in half. I called
              ASAP <br /> and they could have came out the same day but I
              scheduled them to <br /> come out the next day. Gave me a 3:30 pm
              time per my request and <br /> the tech arrived 15 minutes early.
              He was very courteous and got to <br /> work immediately. Replaced
              both springs, inspected the opener motor <br /> and greased all
              the hinges and rollers. The garage door is the best it’s <br />{" "}
              ever been since I owned my home. He was in and out within 45{" "}
              <br /> minutes and for just under $200. The best part is that it
              comes with a <br /> 2 year warranty. ASAP will be my go to for any
              garage door repair <br /> needs in the future!

              I used the services of ASAP Garage Door Repair. My garage door

              opener was sheared off. Everything was great. They literally were

            <p>
              My garage pretty much self-destructed. Because the torsion springs
              <br />
              were never re-adjusted in probably 12 years, all the garage weight
              was <br /> being pulled by the opener. The internal nylon gears on
              the motor <br /> stripped. I called at 7am, they were able to come
              out that afternoon. <br />
              Within about 10-15 minutes he already had the thing fixed (no
              springs <br />
              to replace). Since he was so quick, I asked what it would cost to
              install <br />
              my opener and whether or not he could fit the install in his
              schedule <br />
              today (it’s 20 degrees outside in december so it’s worth paying to
              have <br />
              it installed). It was $150 to install the craftsman I bought
              (Sears was <br />
              going to charge $130, but he also upgraded the support rails to
              thicker <br />
              stronger material).
            </p>
            <p>
              In 90 minutes he was done with the installation, including
              adjusting <br />
              the force and stopping points. He recommended I oil all the
              contacts <br />
              points again with some 10W30 oil in a couple months, and also when
              <br />
              it warms back up that I stop by and get a replacement rubber strip
              for <br />
              the bottom of the door for $28 (there is a gap on one side of the
              door). <br />
              All in all, Couldn’t ask for better service!

              A recent previous broken garage door spring repair was originated
              <br />
              from an Angie’s List search. An amazingly quick and thorough job
              with <br />
              very positive results led to a very favorable rating on Angie’s
              List.
              <br /> Based on this experience, I requested an estimate on a
              broken garage
              <br /> door repair/replacement on a different townhome property.
              The <br />
              estimator was able to outline different options and ultimately, a
              panel
              <br /> replacement was contracted. ASAP Garage Door Repair is an
